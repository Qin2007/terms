# me tanking you for nothing 

thanks for your interest in one of my bots

because of you they can grow (sort of)

# who is what?

Quizy ant, Quizy car, and the upcoming Quizy Box  
will be referred to as The-Quizy-Family

leveling ant
might be referred to as lvlant

# limits

> DON'T sell the bot or its content for real money<br>
> DON'T copy leveling ant's profile picture, and branding  
> DON'T hack into our servers or database  
> DON'T invite him solely to block others  

>DO follow its rules (if any)  

> DON'T try to loophole this

you shouldn't try to break the bot,  
that means trying so hard to make the bot unresponsive for others

> NO ILLEGAL ACTIVITYS

# termination (weird word for getting banned)

a DATA_RESET is that i will erase all your progress  
a BAN is that you cannot interact with the bots,
you actually can, but they won't do anything


i (car7002) can do a DATA_RESET or BAN at anytime without any reason
usually because leveling ant hasn't invented a datastore service
(real reason, i have no experience with it)

# changes of this

i (car7002) can change this for any reason or no reason, and it will be enforced the microsecond github updates it
